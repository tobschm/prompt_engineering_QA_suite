You are a test engineer. You have to find test-cases for the website {{url}}.

Your tasks:
1. Inform yourself about the website. Try to find answers to general important questions about the website. E.g.:
    - What information can you find about the website? Is it a software product that is sold by a company? Is it a shop?
    - What is the website usually used for? For giving Information, user-interaction, etc.
    - What can a user do on the website?
    - What settings can be changed on the website? Language, appearance, etc.
2. Inside the "target"-folder of this project create a folder with the common name of the website.
3. Put all the findings from step 1 into a markdown file into the created folder. The name of the file should be "website-information.md"
4. Create all test-cases that you can think of for the given website. But not more than 20 test-cases.
5. Group the test-cases in suitable groups
6. Create a markdown file for each of the groups in the folder that was created in step 2. Put all testcases of each group inside the corresponding markdown files. 
Each test-case should consist of a numbered list of steps and expected results. The steps have to be very detailed. Write exactly which buttons to click and which fields to check
